 First, we created four local BLAST databases from the genomes of each Chlamydia strain.
 After the databases were computed, we ran BLAST for each gene of one organism on the databases of the other three,
 producing a set of genomic pairwise files. Each gene was then matched to its NCBI Locus Tag identifier.
  We called these files parsed_[subject genome]_v_[query genome]. Using the parsed files as reference,
  we generated a histogram with Python’s matplotlib to sort the e-values into bins and determined a threshold at 1e-25
  was necessary to remove insignificant data (high E-values) from the parsed files. After filtering the pairwise results
  by the threshold, the remaining results were further reduced by choosing only the match with the lowest E score,
  or selection of multiple in rare instances of a tie. After mapping each gene to its best BLAST result(s) (usually single),
  we performed an iterative analysis of every genes’ mappings to check if the query gene was also in the set of its subject.
  If the results were reciprocal (gene a in X mapped to gene b in Y, and gene b in Y mapped to gene a in X), then output was
  written to the file [genome]_v_[genome]_rbm.tab. Otherwise, the output was stored in [genome]_v_[genome]_non_rbm.tab.
  Finally, we generated cliques by grouping genes together based on their reciprocity of their BLAST results. In the case of a
   perfect 4-way clique, the resulting set contained exactly 4 NCBI genes (one from each strain). Otherwise, an uncertain set
   could contain >4 genes (meaning there were multiple best hits found for some gene in the set, or >1 genes had different
   pairwise best matches to >1 strains). Cliques were filtered by size; perfect cliques with 4 genes (1 from each strain)
   were stored in cliques_4_rbm.tab, sets with only 3 genes, or >4 genes, were saved in cliques_3_rbm.tab (and a separate
   details file which prints the results from the parsed blast file), and sets with 2 genes (meaning only pairwise best hits
   found) were saved in cliques_2_rbm.tab. These cliques files were manually curated for accuracy and loaded into Wikidata.
